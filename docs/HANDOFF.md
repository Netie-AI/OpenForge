# OpenForge — Session Handoff

**Updated:** 2026-06-20 (BSIM CI green on PR #1; schematic tangling ≤3)  
**HEAD (local):** `55ff958` on `feat/schematic-orthogonal-router` (pushed)  
**PR:** [#1](https://github.com/Netie-AI/OpenForge/pull/1) — Actions [#27875600582](https://github.com/Netie-AI/OpenForge/actions/runs/27875600582) green

**Structural log:** `docs/semicon-log.md` entries 2–6 — vref Option B locked; CMRR bench landed but requires normalization/fixture follow-up before acceptance.

**Read order:** this file → `docs/STATUS.md` → `docs/PARKING_LOT.md` → `AGENT_PLAN.md` §0 → `.cursor/skills/openforge-conventions/SKILL.md` → `.cursor/skills/mode-routing/SKILL.md`

Use this file at the **start of every new Cursor window**.

## North star (long term)

**OpenForge** = analog IC design forge: datasheet spec → ngspice-validated netlist + measured specs → (later) evolutionary topology search → (later) multitask LoRA that only ships fitness=1 designs.

Ultimate demo (Phase 5 exit): *"design me a low-Vos comparator under 1 µA"* → verifier-gated netlist with real ngspice numbers.

Broader product vision (CEO master plan tail in `AGENT_PLAN.md`): Palantir/Cadence-friendly UI, assisted editing (add a wire → re-sim → new topology class), DRC/LVS, parasitic extraction — **all gated on honest ngspice fitness=1 first.**

## Short term (do next)

| Priority | Task | Gate |
|----------|------|------|
| **1** | ~~**BSIM CI proof via PR**~~ | **Done 2026-06-20:** [PR #1](https://github.com/Netie-AI/OpenForge/pull/1); [Actions #27875600582](https://github.com/Netie-AI/OpenForge/actions/runs/27875600582) — `sky130-bsim-smoke` + `test` **pass** |
| **2** | **CMRR — parked (Option B honest partial)** | RL=10k fixture run complete (dv-verifier confirmed): **152.0→127.4 dB** (−24.6 dB, CM-path only); **47 dB above** RS321 typ. **Stop CMRR churn** until Monte Carlo Phase 4+. |
| **3** | **UI E2E (human tick)** | `docs/UI_E2E_CHECKLIST.md` — agent PASS 2026-06-20; footer git hash DOM bug optional fix |
| **4** | ~~**Schematic tangling — Cc passive tap**~~ | **Done 2026-06-20:** `schematic_router.py` passive second pass; **`crossing_score` 6→3**; pytest **19/19** |
| Parking lot | Generative layout pilot (ALIGN/MAGICAL) | Phase 7+ — see `docs/research/GENERATIVE_ANALOG_LAYOUT_SURVEY.md`; after BSIM CI PR |

**Do NOT start:** Phase 4/5, LoRA, cross-repo Cursor brain, layout/DRC/LVS, PLL/SerDes/standard-cells/high-speed IO (`PARKING_LOT.md` § out of scope).

### Phase 3 vref — decision locked (**Option B**, 2026-06-20)

**Evidence:** `scripts/diag_vref_iq_breakdown.py` + `scripts/verify_phase3_vref.py` (end-to-end; exit 1 on iq = honest fail, not crash).

| Run | iq µA | vref V | line_reg mV |
|-----|-------|--------|-------------|
| defaults | 203.8 | 1.146 | 1.30 |
| manual amp floor (`iref_amp=1 µA`) | **166.0** | 1.152 | 0.69 |
| sized (seed=42, budget=80) | 138.5 | 1.196 | 1.25 |

**Verdict:** iq **not closable by sizing alone** — structural floor ~166 µA (PMOS mirror + BJT stack). Dead `ibias_uA` sizer knob removed.

**Decision: Option B — honest partial.** Topology + real error amp validated; **iq remains open** on level-1 BJT placeholders. Do **not** burn seeds or param sweeps on iq now. Revisit **Option A** (bias architecture redesign) only when (1) RS431 iq is a hard demo gate, or (2) real SKY130 BJT cards land.

**Next engineering:** PVT/testbench expansion (not vref iq redesign).

### Recently done (this session chain)

| Item | Notes |
|------|-------|
| 0.7 connectivity + IO stubs | Verifier caught 16px gap; tests 10/10 |
| 0.8 stub-then-fold sign-off | Parent + `dv-verifier` rerun complete: `pytest tests/test_schematic_connectivity.py -v` **14/14 pass**; `logs/schematic_0.8_*.svg` vs 0.7 confirms terminal-stub deltas (`0→21`, `0→20`) |
| UI hotfix | `renderError()` restored after JS corruption |
| Docs | `PARKING_LOT.md`, `UI_E2E_CHECKLIST.md`, `SESSION_NOTES.md`, etc. |
| VCVS → real error amp | vref topology validated; **iq still open** |
| BSIM smoke + CI wiring | Local rerun at `85a8d51`: `OPENFORGE_MODEL_SET=sky130 OPENFORGE_SKY130_CARD=bsim python scripts/smoke_all.py 80` = **5/5 pass** (`vref` deferred); `.github/workflows/ci.yml` includes `sky130-bsim-smoke` job — **Actions URL not verified** (needs PR; branch has no PR runs yet) |
| CMRR tail/bias sweep | `diag_opamp_cmrr_breakdown.py` rerun: Lb sweep **159.5→125.5 dB** (0.5→8 µm); rl10k fixture **15–25 dB** below open-loop on defaults. Policy lock **reverted** — fixture decision held until causal story + datasheet equivalence |
| CMRR RL=10k fixture (authorized one-shot) | `diag_opamp_cmrr_fixture.py`: defaults **152.0→127.4 dB** (−24.6 dB); still **47 dB above** RS321 typ 80 dB. **Option B parked** — stop churn until Monte Carlo Phase 4+ |
| Schematic Miller passive tap | `route_nets()` second pass for 2-terminal C/R; **`crossing_score` 6→3**; `tests/test_schematic_no_tangling.py` bound tightened to ≤3 |

**Rule 8:** Never add a second looser tolerance. Never mark a phase done without **Actions green on pushed HEAD**.

---

## Phase 1 lessons (apply to 1d)

1. **Diagnose before sizing** — large misses often mean wrong bench or topology bug, not "try more seeds."
2. **Show causal evidence** — param diffs, netlist structure identity, seed sweep, re-measure historical failures.
3. **Historical numbers may be stale** — comparator 8 µs was old tran deck (`99d68df`); switch 834 Ω was S/D swap (`175da53`); charge pump 4.27 V was pre-bootstrap (`8297008`).
4. **Behavioral test must assert real ngspice metrics** — not `_design()` pass alone.
5. **CI green ≠ claim true** — verify underlying cause, then push, then check Actions tab.

---

## What this session closed vs left open

### Closed (with evidence)
- **0.7 verifier:** IO stubs must reach terminals; parser fix for `class="signal-wire io-stub"`; tests caught 16px gap then passed after fix.
- **SVG emitter:** Valid CSS classes; dynamic IO stub coords; golden logs `logs/schematic_0.7_*.svg`.
- **0.8 router + sign-off:** `terminal_stub()` + orthogonal routing — `logs/schematic_0.8_orthogonal_*.svg`; parent + `dv-verifier` rerun `pytest tests/test_schematic_connectivity.py -v` (14/14), with SVG compare showing terminal-stub markers in 0.8 only.
- **UI hotfix:** Restored `renderError()` after JS corruption; `node --check` on embedded script.
- **Docs:** `PARKING_LOT.md`, `UI_E2E_CHECKLIST.md`, `analog_design_rules.md` (stub rule), `SESSION_NOTES.md`, `VERIFY_BRIEF.md`.

### Open (real gates)
- **PVT / testbench metrics** — **PSRR @ 100 Hz landed** with W3 causal story (`verify_psrr.py`). **CMRR bench `partial`** — normalization fixed, tail/bias sweep shows Lb is dominant knob, but **152 dB open-loop magnitude not physically credible** on bundled models; RL=10k drops ~25 dB but still >>80 dB typ. **No fixture policy lock.** See `semicon-log.md` entry 6.
- **BSIM in CI** — `sky130-bsim-smoke` job at `ef43ef6`; docs sync through `85a8d51`; local WSL smoke **5/5** at `85a8d51`; **Actions URL not verified** (workflow runs on PR only; no PR runs yet).
- **Schematic tangling residual** — `tests/test_schematic_no_tangling.py` **5/5**; chosen variant `tail_aligned`, `nb` x-span **300→174**; `crossing_score=6` (target `<=3`) — next: Cc passive tap second pass.
- **vref iq** — documented open (Option B); verify gate exits 1 honestly — not a sizing sprint. Three untracked `scripts/diag_vref_*.py` files (`topology`, `selfbias_pnp`, `tune`) are **pre–Option B historical exploration** (alternate bandgap topologies / PNP paths); **not authorized reopening** — do not run for iq sizing; delete or move to `scripts/archive/` in a future cleanup pass.

### Discipline reminders
- Passing connectivity tests ≠ schematic looks good ≠ UI loads.
- UI churn caused a startup crash — always run `UI_E2E_CHECKLIST.md` after `index.html` edits.
- Generic external roadmaps restate `AGENT_PLAN.md` — fold to parking lot, don’t panic-replan.
- Governance ownership lock: treat `.cursor/agents/`, `.cursor/rules/`, and `.cursor/skills/` as owner-managed; executor agents do not modify them unless explicitly instructed by owner.
- Mode routing: composer-mode requires Claude verification before gate progression; non-composer (Codex) mode may complete locally with `dv-verifier` + parent re-run evidence.
- Shorthand contract: user `continue` = execute next step now; user `continue and next window` = execute now and output next-window snippet (files + skills/rules + agent pipeline).

## Findings closure (Claude review — 2026-06-20)

**Accepted with evidence:**

| Finding | Verdict | Evidence |
|---------|---------|----------|
| 0.8 orthogonal routing (stub-then-fold) | ✅ **working** | `schematic_router.py` + `route_nets()` in render path; connectivity **14/14** |
| Root cause = **placement distance** on `nb` net (M8/M5/M7), not draw bug | ✅ **confirmed** | Topology ties in `opamp.py`; floorplan zones in `schematic_layout.py`; `tail_aligned` drops `nb` x-span **300→174** |
| 0.8 improved **routing style**, not placement root cause | ✅ **confirmed** | SVG deltas: opamp `terminal_stub` 0→21, comparator 0→20; io-stub unchanged 3→3 |
| Cherry-pick integration (geometry + variant scoring + tests) | ✅ **landed** | `ef43ef6`: `schematic_geometry.py`, `_STAGE2_VARIANTS`, `tests/test_schematic_no_tangling.py` **5/5** |
| `files/` bundle standalone | ⚠️ **reference-only** | `files/test_schematic_no_tangling.py` fails `<=3` (score=6); `standalone_integration_smoke.py` expects `isolated` winner — production picks `tail_aligned` |
| Residual tangling | ⚠️ **partial** | `crossing_score=6` (target ≤3); next cut: Cc passive tap second pass |

**Do not:** wholesale replace `openanalog/eda/schematic_layout.py` with `files/schematic_layout.py`.

---

## Tangling next cut (planned — after BSIM CI PR)

**Current (partial):** variant `tail_aligned`; `nb` x-span **300→174**; `crossing_score=6` (target `<=3`). Tests: `test_schematic_no_tangling.py` **5/5**, `test_schematic_connectivity.py` **14/14**.

**Architecture boundary (do not break):** keep production `route_nets()` in `schematic_router.py`; placement scoring stays in `schematic_layout.py` via `_choose_opamp_variant()`.

**Next iteration steps:**
1. **Cc passive tap second pass** — after primary `route_nets(layout.placed)`, route Miller cap (`Cc`) as short orthogonal taps on already-routed `vout`/`nout1` nets (localized stubs near M6/M7), not as a competing long net through the floorplan core.
2. **Re-score with `schematic_geometry.score_layout`** — objective remains `crossing_score + span_penalty` for `nb`; accept only if `crossing_score` drops toward `<=3`.
3. **Guard rails** — no wholesale merge from `files/schematic_layout.py`; `files/` `<=3` assertion is reference-only until adapted to production API.
4. **Verify gate** — `pytest tests/test_schematic_no_tangling.py -q` and `pytest tests/test_schematic_connectivity.py -v` must stay green before any STATUS upgrade from `partial`.

## Copy-paste — next **Cursor** window (executor)

```
Read first: docs/HANDOFF.md, docs/PARKING_LOT.md (Do next only), .cursor/skills/openforge-conventions/SKILL.md, .cursor/skills/mode-routing/SKILL.md

You are the executor. Do NOT expand scope.

Sequence:
1. BSIM CI proof: push/PR and record first green `sky130-bsim-smoke` Actions URL in `docs/STATUS.md`.
2. CMRR fixture policy decision — keep bench-only until datasheet-equivalence is proven (`diag_opamp_cmrr_fixture.py` evidence already landed).
3. Schematic tangling follow-up: keep `route_nets()` path, reduce opamp `crossing_score` from 6 toward `<=3`, preserve `tests/test_schematic_connectivity.py` green.

Do NOT: vref iq sizing sweeps (Option B locked), Phase 4/5, LoRA, PLL/SerDes/vision→corpus, layout/DRC/LVS.
Do NOT: edit `.cursor/agents`, `.cursor/rules`, `.cursor/skills` (owner-managed governance files).
If user says "continue", execute next step now (not plan-only).
If user says "continue and next window", execute now and finish with a concise next-window handoff snippet.

Evidence: paste command output, diff, or artifact paths. Zero-trust — no "trust me" summaries.

Env: WSL Ubuntu + .venv_wsl for ngspice; Windows .venv for web (python -m openanalog.web).
```

## Copy-paste — next **Claude** window (reviewer / gatekeeper)

```
Read first: docs/HANDOFF.md, docs/STATUS.md, docs/PARKING_LOT.md, docs/research/GENERATIVE_ANALOG_LAYOUT_SURVEY.md

You are the reviewer, not the patch author. Gate acceptance on evidence.

This session context:
- Findings closure: 0.8 router working; nb placement pressure confirmed; cherry-pick landed at ef43ef6/85a8d51; crossing_score=6 partial; files/ reference-only.
- BSIM CI: sky130-bsim-smoke wired; Actions URL blocked on PR (gh not authenticated).
- vref Option B locked — topology validated, iq open on placeholder BJTs.
- Layout survey: ALIGN/MAGICAL/OpenFASOC are Phase 7+ downstream of forge; SerDes/HBM remain parking lot.

When Cursor returns work, check:
1. Real ngspice bench output for new metric (not stub pass alone)
2. git diff / pytest output / STATUS update consistency
3. No scope creep into Phase 4+ layout integration without pilot gate
4. Generative layout memo items mapped to parking lot, not immediate sprint

Push back on: restated roadmaps, "tests passed" without output, claiming GDS/layout done without DRC/LVS artifacts.
```

## Copy-paste prompt — legacy (Phase 3 only)

```
Read docs/HANDOFF.md and docs/STATUS.md first.

Phase 1–2 closed. Phase 3: BSIM 5/5 smoke on pinned v0.13.0 (local only).
Evidence: evidence/phase3_*_2026-06-19.log

Next (legacy note): vref bandgap on SKY130 BJTs, then BSIM CI follow-up. Current active priority is higher in this file: capture first green pushed-HEAD `sky130-bsim-smoke` Actions proof URL.
Do NOT start Phase 4/5 or LoRA training.
Zero-trust: done = real artifacts checked, not summaries.
